Your source can be a journal article (research or technology note) or anarticle online in a tech-trade magazine. Blogs are not allowed unless they arecomparing and contrast (If you have trouble accessing any articles see theConsolidated Information Center or contact me if they cannot help). Your workmay not directly use the textbook implementation we discussed (e.g. Google’sBig Table). But you must identify what is different about the approach.

Discuss how the topic was applied to solve a particular problem. Your textshould identify who was involved, what they did, when they did it, where it isbeing used, and why they used it.
